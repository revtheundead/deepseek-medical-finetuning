# DeepSeek Medical Fine-Tuning 🩺

## Overview
This project fine-tunes **DeepSeek R1**, a powerful language model, to enhance its performance in **medical reasoning, diagnostics, and response accuracy**. The goal is to make medical AI **more reliable, concise, and structured** by training the model on relevant datasets and optimizing it for clinical applications.

## Features 🚀
- **Fine-tuned DeepSeek R1** for medical Q&A and decision support.
- **Utilizes Unsloth & Hugging Face Transformers** for efficient training.
- **Runs on Kaggle Notebooks** for accessible, scalable model fine-tuning.
- **Improves response clarity, structure, and evidence-based reasoning.**

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Load DeepSeek R1 and Tokenizer**: Using `FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained()`.
2. **Prepare the Dataset**: Medical questions and expert-verified answers for training.
3. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Optimized training with `Unsloth` for efficiency.
4. **Evaluate Performance**: Comparing pre- and post-fine-tuning outputs.
5. **Deploy & Test**: Use the model for AI-powered medical assistance.

## Running on Kaggle Notebooks 📌
We recommend running this project in **Kaggle Notebooks** to take advantage of free GPU access.

### Steps to Run in Kaggle:
1. **Go to [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code)** and create a new notebook.
2. **Set GPU accelerator**: Click on *Settings* > *Accelerator* > *GPU (T4 x2)*.
3. **Clone this repository** and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepseek-medical-finetuning.git
   %cd deepseek-medical-finetuning
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the fine-tuning script**:
   ```bash
   !python fine_tune.py
   ```
5. **Test the model**:
   ```python
   from model import generate_response
   print(generate_response("What are the symptoms of myocardial infarction?"))
   ```

## Results 📊
- **Improved clinical reasoning**: More structured & accurate responses.
- **Better diagnostic explanations**: Clearer connections between symptoms & conditions.
- **Potential use cases**: Medical Q&A bots, clinical decision support, AI-driven documentation.

## Future Work 🔬
- This project is final, but potential extensions could include expanding the dataset with real-world medical cases.
- Integrate reinforcement learning for enhanced decision-making.
- Fine-tune for specific medical specialties (e.g., radiology, cardiology).
